# Notes:
- The database has some records for testing.
- some users are already registered for testing:
  - username: Eladc Password: 4
  - username: aviel Password: 4
- You can also register your own account
- in order to make the proccess check easier we made the 
    image upload optional, but it is a fully functional operation
    which saves the image in the Date Base

# Instructions:
- you may need to configure JDK mantually in the intellij, we cant configure this through the project itself.
- same with the Run configuration
